***What is a Trello Board?

    A Trello board is a digital tool used to organize projects and tasks visually.
    It works like a virtual bulletin board where you can manage work, track progress, and collaborate with others.

***How it works:

     You create a board for your project.
     Add lists to represent stages or categories.
     Add cards inside lists for individual tasks.
     Drag and drop cards between lists as tasks progress.
     Collaborate with teammates by assigning cards, commenting, and sharing files.
